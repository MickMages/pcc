# make an if, elif, else statement that prompts a user for a number, then compares that number (1 if, 2 elif's) and then has and else case (catchall)
#have python compare the number to a true/false modulo statement to figure out if the number entered is a multiple of 2,3,5 or none of the above.
# have 1 print statement in each case informing the user of the multiple case (EX: "4 is a mulitple of 2", 4 is the value entered initially)
